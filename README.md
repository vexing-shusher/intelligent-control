# Intelligent control
This repository contains the homeworks I have done while attending the Intelligent Control course at the National Taipei University of Technology.

# Contents
1. ANN -- two types of neural network-based controller applied to the tasks of controlling the DC-motor and the Magnetic suspension system.
2. FSMC -- FSMC and adaptive FSMC controllers applied to the Spring pendulum system.
3. FuzzyPole -- controlling the pole on a cart using fuzzy logic controller.
4. GAPole -- optimizing a PID controller using genetic algorithm.
5. PSOPole -- optimizing a PID controller using particle swarm optimization algorithm.
